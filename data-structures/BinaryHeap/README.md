# Binary Heap

## Description
Heaps are an specific form of tree
Its very similar to a binary search tree but it has different rules
In a maxBinaryHeap the parent nodes are always larger than child nodes
In a minBinaryHeap the parent nodes are always smaller than child nodes
rules of max
each parent has at most two nodes
the parent is greater than the children but there are no guarantees between siblings
is compact as possible
all the children of each node are as full as they can be and left children
