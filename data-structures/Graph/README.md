# Graph

## Description
A graph data structure consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) set of vertices or nodes or points, together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an unidirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph.

It is basically a collection of nodes and connections.

- Vertex - node
- Edge - connection between nodes
- Weighted/Unweighted - values assigned to distances between vertices
- Directed/Undirected - direction assigned to distanced between vertices.

## Approaches to store the data

### Adjacency Matrix

### Adjacency List

## Methods

## Big O

* Insertion - O(1)
* Removal - O(1)
* Access - O(1)
