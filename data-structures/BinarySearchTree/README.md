# Binary Tree

## Description

In BST every parent node has at most two children
eveary node on the left of the parent node is always less that the parent, and every node on the right of the parent is greater than the parent

#### BST Traverse
There are many ways to traverse and get the values of the nodes of a binary tree:

##### Breadth First
With breadth first algorithm we visit nodes on an horizontal way first, so we can get the node values ordered by the levels of the tree.

##### Depth First
> Pre Order
> Post Order
> In Order



Real life example:
```
HTML DOM
Network routing
Abstract syntax trees
AI (Artificial Intelligence)
Folders in Operating Systems
JSON
```

## Methods

## Big O

* Insertion - O(log n)
* Removal - O(log n)
